Error1:
 'Instance of .. has no .. member' for class with dynamic attributes
Solution:  http://pylint-messages.wikidot.com/messages:e1101

Error2: While defining class, there was a mistake in indentation. After class definition, I assinged the variables.
The variables were not indented correctly. This casued the interpreter to mistakenly consider the assignment of varibles 
as a part of classs and when I was debugging it threw error variable not defined which was the calss name. This was not apparent 
in the pylint code check.
